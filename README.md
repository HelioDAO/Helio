## **Core Architecture**

Helio’s architecture is built around three key components to ensure scalability, reliability, and seamless interaction with the Solana ecosystem:

### **Core**
The backbone of Helio, responsible for managing communication with the Solana blockchain.  
- Written in **Rust** for maximum compatibility, speed, and reliability.  
- Ensures low-latency and high-throughput transaction processing.  

### **Swarm**
A decentralized AI processing network powered by distributed nodes.  
- Built with **Rust**, **WASM (WebAssembly)**, and **Kubernetes** for scalability and security.  
- Enables decentralized AI computations with dynamic resource allocation.

### **Logic**
The decision-making layer where AI models are executed to analyze data and automate workflows.  
- Powered by **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **PyTorch** for advanced analytics and predictions.  
- Modular structure allows developers to create and integrate custom logic for specific use cases.
